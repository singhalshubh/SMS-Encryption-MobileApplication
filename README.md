# SMS-Encryption-MobileApplication
The project focuses on the basic sms transfer from one sender to another safely. The "safe" word
describes that any intruder should not be able to retrieve the message from the known attacks
in cryptography, hence making it trustable source of communication. The application consists of
a instant and secure login. The application, then asks the user whether he/she wants to craft a
message or see his inbox to figure out whatâ€™s new? The crafting of message includes the feature of
accessing the contacts. The user can instantly see his message and the corresponding cipher text.
There is a tutorial accompanied to understand how the encryption and decryption is being done. The
receiver finally will receive the sms which this application will decrypt and store in its inbox. The
app also supports group messaging, wherein a common message can be sent to a group of receivers. 

It provides an additional layer of Encryption of AES as GCM is vulnerable to many known attacks.
Supports API level 25 and below.
